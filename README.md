# Lineal_Actuator
Lineal system to determine position given by a signal and controlled by a PID.

# Objective
This project is given by a Tecnologico de Monterrey and John Deere´s challenge in order to implement a PID controller 
on a linear system.

# Development of the system
The system involves a screw-nut system where the screw rotates and with a nut,
the nut is able to move freely within a given range of the system.

The rotation is made by a DC motor of 6-12V and it has an encoder.
The project has an ultrasonic sensor in order to make precise data and ranges.

# Componentes
1. Motor-Encoder CHR-GM25-370.
2. Motor JGA25-370.
3. L298N H Bridge.
4. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor.
5. Arduino UNO.
